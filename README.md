# WINE TAP README
<b>Thank you for giving Wine Tap a try.</b>

This small application complements WINE by enabling you to double-click on any WINDOWS EXECUTABLE file to launch it into wine rather than loading the same executable file through a command-line interface. This will save you time and for anyone who may be skittish about using the command-line, this is the answer for you!

<b>Don't have wine? It's simple to install.</b>
You have many options but my preference is to shy away from bloated apps that have WINE embedded. Thus this little app called Wine Tap.

<b>PROBLEM</b>: When bloated apps need updated, the associated download is big too.<br>
<b>SOLUTION</b>: Install wine on you system using HOMEBREW. Its quick, easy and will save you time down the road.

Not every one is a super-geek. So here is what you need to get WINE and tap into its magic with WINE TAP in 3 easy steps:

<b>1) OPEN THE Terminal.app</b>
You can find it by opening your Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder. 
Inside you will find the Terminal.app (it has a mostly black icon).

<b>2) INSTALL HOMEBREW</b>
Copy and Paste the following line into the terminal and press RETURN:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

<b>3) INSTALL WINE</b>
Once your installation of HOMEBREW is complete, Copy and Paste the following line into the terminal and press RETURN:
brew install wine

<b>THAT'S IT!</b>
This will take a couple of moments. There are several smaller components that are needed in order for Wine to run on your machine. 

Now that Wine is installed, move Wine Tap to your Applications folder. Now you can double-click on any WINDOWS EXECUTABLE file and Wine Tap will do the rest.

<b><i>NOTICE:</b> WINE takes a moment to get that executable file running. It it not like launching a native Mac app, so give it time. After all, you are running windows software on your mac without installing windows—which is pretty awesome—so be patient.</i>

Enjoy!
